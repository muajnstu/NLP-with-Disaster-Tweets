Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms where people write tweets with hashtags in order to convey their message to the social media community. One of the main advantages of Twitter is that the government agencies of almost all the countries are proactive on Twitter.

As Twitter provides its tweets data for analysis through its APIs which helps research agencies/organizations to programmatically analyze tweets and recognize disasters and emergencies. This kind of alert system can help millions of people connected to the internet in the form of getting alerts in the case of an emergency or disaster. But the major challenge is how to segregate tweets conveying disaster messages from the ones which are not related to a disaster.
