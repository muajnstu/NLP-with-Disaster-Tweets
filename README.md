<b> Dataset description </b>
In this project, we will be using the training set of the Kaggle competition Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets dataset for training our machine learning models. This dataset consists of 7,613 tweets and has following features:

id: Unique id assigned to each tweet.
keyword: keyword associated with the tweet (although this may be blank!).
location: The location tweet was sent from (may also be blank)
text: The text of a tweet.
target: It has two values 0 denotes a normal tweet & 1 denotes an actual disaster tweetSocial media messages are an important source of information in times of crisis. As the information on social media spreads like fire which may help recovery and disaster organizations to reach the affected place on time and provide their support services.

Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms where people write tweets with hashtags in order to convey their message to the social media community. One of the main advantages of Twitter is that the government agencies of almost all the countries are proactive on Twitter.

As Twitter provides its tweets data for analysis through its APIs which helps research agencies/organizations to programmatically analyze tweets and recognize disasters and emergencies. This kind of alert system can help millions of people connected to the internet in the form of getting alerts in the case of an emergency or disaster. But the major challenge is how to segregate tweets conveying disaster messages from the ones which are not related to a disaster.
